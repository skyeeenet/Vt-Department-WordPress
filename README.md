Global theme settings were moved to a separate page in the admin panel. To create custom fields, the Carbon Fields plugin was used. Most of the fields are edited directly from the admin panel. 

For news and announcements, an arbitrary type of records was used, which was extended by custom fields.

For creation of the schedule, Ajax handler was used, which allows displaying the schedule on the page without reloading the page. The schedule itself is controlled from the admin panel, which provides for adding all the necessary parameters for filtering and displaying the desired schedule.
